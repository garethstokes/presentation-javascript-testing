Testing the javascripts
=======================

These are my slides made specially for the fine people
over at the sydney alt.net meetup. 

Although I recommend checking out the 
package.json / Gruntfile.js as examples for setting 
up your own javascript project, please dont look too 
carefully at all the awesome js / spec code as it 
was written in quite a hurry on the weekend. 

to get set up..

first:
  install nodejs
  then check out this repo

```
  npm install -g grunt-cli
```

```
  npm install
```

```
  grunt dev
```

open up your browser and navigate to localhost:8080
